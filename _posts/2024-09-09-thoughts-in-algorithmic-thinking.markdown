You know how machine learning works. There are no predefined things to follow to achieve things. The patterns are being identified and used to learn.
So, bye to all step by step processes. Lets talk Psychology.

Things that are helpful :
how are you thinking now?
What are the learnings that needs to be provided to your brain/neurons
resolve them

So, what are the things need to be considered while solving things?

1. Track your current thought process
2. Identify the thought processes that needs to be adjusted
3. Learn.

First thought on transforming this process to an algorithm(any real world thing can be converted to a procedure, sadly, and procedure is essentially an algorithm).

Get domains and codomains
Get some testcases. There should be general test cases as well as testcases including edges.
Think, think, think and go through the test cases till you get an idea on how to solve the problem

PS : If above three steps go beyond 20 minutes and either you didn't get an approach or you got a complex approach, straight dive into the solution.

Else, code and execute your solution. If the solution passes, your thought process is okay. If not, get testcases that didn't work, and go back to step 1. 
If step 1 fails, that means you messed up domain matching, which is strictly forbidden to do. Else, just normally execute from step 2, like a frest attempt solving the problem(PS applicable here as fresh).
